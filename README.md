<!-- [scripts/littlesis-graph-exploration.ipynb](scripts/littlesis-graph-exploration.ipynb) is a good place to start if you want to explore the data. -->

### Data

The only data included in the repository is the voteview data. This can also be downloaded from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/) and save it as [data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv](data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv).

The rest of the data can be downloaded by running the following command:

```bash
sh scripts/download-data.sh
```

In case you want to download the data manually, you can find it here: [littlesis.org/data](https://littlesis.org/data)

Congress-legistlator data can be downloaded here: [github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/main/legislators-historical.yaml) and converted with [scripts/yaml-to-json.py](scripts/yaml-to-json.py)

### Data description

[data/sources/littlesis-{entities,relationships}.json](data/sources/) contain the graph nodes and edges. [littlesis](https://littlesis.org/) is a database of connections between people and organizations. I use the entities.json and the relationships.json files to create a graph of the connections between people and organizations.

[data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv](data/voteview-HS117_members.csv) contains the ideology scores for the members of the 117th House of Representatives taken from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/).

[data/sources/legislators-historical.json](data/sources/legislators-historical.json) contains data about the members of congress. It is taken from [github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/main/legislators-historical.yaml).

### Initializing the database

Since I have data from many sources I decided to combine the information I need in a single "database". It is not a real database, but a `database.csv` with the neccesary information. The database is initialized by running the following command:

```bash
python scripts/initialize-database.py
```
