The code for my elective project, supervised by [Michele Coscia](https://www.michelecoscia.com/).

## How to use

It should be noted that there are a kind of *timeline* to the code as this is series of experiments. I've tried to limit the need for running the code in a specific order, but it is still recommended to follow the order below.

### Data

The only data included in the repository is the voteview data. This can also be downloaded from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/) and save it as [data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv](data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv).

The rest of the data can be downloaded by running the following command:

```bash
sh scripts/download-data.sh
```

In case you want to download the data manually, you can find it here: [littlesis.org/data](https://littlesis.org/data)

Congress-legistlator data can be downloaded here: [github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/main/legislators-historical.yaml) and converted with [scripts/yaml-to-json.py](scripts/yaml-to-json.py)

### Data description

[data/sources/littlesis-{entities,relationships}.json](data/sources/) contain the graph nodes and edges. [littlesis](https://littlesis.org/) is a database of connections between people and organizations. I use the entities.json and the relationships.json files to create a graph of the connections between people and organizations.

[data/sources/voteview-HS117_members.csv](data/voteview-HS117_members.csv) contains the ideology scores for the members of the 117th House of Representatives taken from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/).

[data/sources/legislators-historical.json](data/sources/legislators-historical.json) contains data about the members of congress. It is taken from [github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/main/legislators-historical.yaml).

### Initializing the database

Since I have data from many sources I decided to combine the information I need in a single "database". It is not a real database, but a `database.csv` with the neccesary information. The database is initialized by running the following command:

```bash
python scripts/initialize-database.py
```

### Node Vector Distance for ideology estimation

In order to perform the node vector distance experiment you need to run the following command:

```bash
python DonorIdeo/nvd.py
```

This code will break at a certain point because it needs the results from a julie script that is able to calculate distances between vectors much faster. This can be executed by running the following command:

```bash
julia scripts/nvd.jl
```

Note that it have a runningtime of approx 6 hours on a Macbook Air M1. When the julia script is done, you can run the python script `DonorIdeo/nvd.py` again and it will finish. It will add information to the `database.csv` file and create three plots in the `assets` folder.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

As seen from the results in the section above, the node vector distance experiment requires a lot of time to run and does not give good results. The assumption was that the donations where a good indicator of ideology, but it seems that node vector calculations are not able to capture this. Therefore I decided to do some exploratory data analysis to see if I could find reasons in the data for this.

The `DonorIdeo/eda.ipynb` notebook contains the code for the exploratory data analysis. It will create a number of plots in the `assets` folder. For a better explanation of the plots, methods and the results, please see the [report](report.pdf).

## Upcoming

- [ ] Currently the node vector consider the entire network. This makes theoretical sense, but reducing the size of the vectors to only consider the donors directly connected to the legislator might improve the results. The vectors will be become drastically smaller and the calculations will be much faster. I can implement this in python.
- [ ] Extend `EDA.ipynb` to include more plots and analysis.
- [ ] Add documentation to the code.
